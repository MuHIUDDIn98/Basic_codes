Binary tree:
A binary tree is a tree data structure whose all nodes have either zero, one, or at most two children nodes.
These two children are generally referred to as left and right children respectively.

The top most node is known as root node , while the nodes with no children are known as leaf nodes.
Each node in a binary tree has these three elements-

1.Data item that is the data stored in the node
2.Address of the left child
3.Address of the right child

Terminologies in Binary tree

1.Nodes- Nodes are the building blocks of any data structure.
        they majorly contain some data and link to the next/previous
         nodes.
        In the case of binary trees, they contain the address of the 
        left and right child respectively.

2.Root- The topmost node in a tree is known as the root node. 
        A tree can have at most one root node.

3.Parent Node - A node(except the root) that has a succeeding node is known as 
                parent node.

4.Child  Node - A node that has a preceding node is known as a child node.
              A node can be both parent and child depending on the node that is in context.

5.Leaf Node - A node with no children.

6.Internal Node - A node that has at least one child node is known as a internal node.

7.Depth of a Binary Tree - The number of edges from a node in the tree to the root node.

8.Height of a Binary Tree - The number of edges from the deepest node in the tree to the root node.
