there is two type of memory 

1.static  limited than dynamic  memory  /

    **compile time memory allocation we can't increase size during run time...

    **it can automatically clear from stack memory


2.dynamic memory is more than static memory / 

    **depend on working requirement it can increase memeory size during run time ,
    that is why we call it run time memory allocation

    **we need to clear it manually from heap memory
