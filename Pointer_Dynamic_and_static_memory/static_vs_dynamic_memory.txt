when we want to use external resourses..like.. external devices. printer, wifi
 we use pointer...
pointer can access data indirectly...

programmer control heap memory.. creation, deletion, update..


there is two type of memory 

1.static  limited than dynamic  memory  /

    **compile time memory allocation we can't increase size during run time...

    **it can automatically clear from stack memory


2.dynamic memory is more than static memory / 

    **depend on working requirement it can increase memeory size during run time ,
    that is why we call it run time memory allocation

    **we need to clear it manually from heap memory
