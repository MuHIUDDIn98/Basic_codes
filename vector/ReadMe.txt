// In C++, a vector is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as needed.
// It is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and is defined in the <vector> header. 
// Vectors are also sometimes referred to as "dynamic arrays" because they provide similar functionality to arrays but with the added benefit of automatic resizing.

/*1. Dynamic Sizing:
     Vectors can dynamically resize themselves to accommodate more elements when they are added, ensuring efficient memory usage.

Random Access: 
     Like arrays, vectors provide constant-time random access to their elements using square bracket notation ([]),
 which means you can access any element directly without iterating through the container.

Contiguous Memory:
      Vectors store their elements in contiguous memory locations, which can be advantageous for certain algorithms and operations.

Insertion and Deletion: 
Vectors support efficient insertion and deletion of elements at the end using push_back and pop_back operations. 
You can also insert or erase elements at arbitrary positions.*/
